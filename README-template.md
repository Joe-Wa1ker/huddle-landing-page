## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Really focussed on semantic HTML, found everything was structured better and easier to style.
- I was prolific in my use of flexbox and pretty much only used margin for auto to center, opting for gap instead.

### Continued development

- Still running into issues with scrolling to the bottom on iPad Mini, Air, Pro and Surface Pro 7 - can't work out why and need to seek some guidance on this.
